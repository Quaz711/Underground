# Underground
A place to search something new

# User Story
As a user with the desire to listen to fresh and new music
I want to randomly generate underground artists via the genre I select
Then when I select an artist from the list
I can view the lyrics and sing along.

#  Concept
We wanted to create a space which was simple and user friendly, with a grungey old school vibe. A space where users can discover non-mainstream music, generating a randomized song, and view it's lyrics. 

# Future Development 
The website will have members log-in which will allow music saving, preview playing, and personalization of their space. We also want to integrate a social aspect to the website where users can share their musical finds, chat, and comment on each others posts.
